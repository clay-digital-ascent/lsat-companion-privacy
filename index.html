    <ul>
        <li><strong>LSAT Educational Content:</strong> When you use the Extension on supported LSAT preparation websites (including 7Sage, LSAT Demon, and Khan Academy), the Extension reads LSAT question text, answer choices, reading passages, and explanatory content solely for the purpose of providing AI-powered tutoring and explanations.</li>
        <li><strong>Study Progress Data:</strong> The Extension stores your interaction history locally in your browser, including which questions you have attempted, your accuracy rates, and time spent on different question types.

        <li><strong>Chat History:</strong> Your conversations with the AI tutor are stored locally to maintain context during study sessions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AI Processing:</strong> LSAT question content is sent to AI service providers (OpenAI GPT models and/or Google Gemini) exclusively to generate educational explanations, answer rationales, and study guidance. No personally identifiable information is included in these API requests.</li>
        <li><strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> Study progress data is analyzed locally to provide personalized recommendations and identify patterns in your LSAT preparation.</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>

        <li>You can delete all stored data at any time by uninstalling the Extension or clearing your browser data for extensions.</li>

    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>

        <li>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your data to third parties for marketing or advertising purposes.</li>
